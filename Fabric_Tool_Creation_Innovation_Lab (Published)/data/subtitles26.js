Slide your fabric\n\n00:11.320 --> 00:14.660\nunder the presser foot and line the edge up with a seam guide\n\n00:15.160 --> 00:18.980\non the needle plate. Use the same guide all the way so\n\n00:19.480 --> 00:21.580\nyour seam allowance stays consistent.\n\n00:26.790 --> 00:30.790\nOnce you\'re set, lower the presser foot to engage the feed dogs.\n\n00:31.190 --> 00:34.830\nPlace your hands to the sides of the needle and press the\n\n00:35.330 --> 00:39.750\npetal gently to begin. Do a short backstitch\n\n00:40.250 --> 00:43.830\nto lock the seam, then sew forward at a steady\n\n00:44.330 --> 00:48.190\npace. Let the machine feed the fabric guide\n\n00:48.690 --> 00:50.390\nlightly. Don\'t push or pull.\n\n01:03.520 --> 01:07.280\nAs you reach the end. Add another quick backstitch.\n\n01:07.920 --> 01:11.240\nStop, Raise the presser\n\n01:11.740 --> 01:17.250\nfoot and pull the fabric back into the left and\n\n01:17.750 --> 01:18.410\nclip the threads.\n\n01:29.530 --> 01:33.050\nNow let\'s sew the sides and bottom. Align the\n\n01:33.550 --> 01:36.970\nnext edge with the same seam guide. Lower the foot,\n\n01:37.210 --> 01:41.130\nbackstitch to lock and continue with a straight stitch. Remove pins\n\n01:41.630 --> 01:43.290\nas you go. Don\'t sew over them.\n\n01:44.830 --> 01:48.030\nAt the corner, stop with the needle down to hold your place.\n\n01:48.190 --> 01:49.390\nRaise the presser foot.\n\n01:53.070 --> 01:55.310\nPivot the fabric to the new direction.\n\n02:00.750 --> 02:02.510\nRealign with the guide,\n\n02:06.030 --> 02:10.400\nlower the foot and\n\n02:10.900 --> 02:11.400\nkeep sewing.\n\n02:15.080 --> 02:18.760\nRepeat that at each corner so your seams stay\n\n02:19.260 --> 02:19.320\nsquare.\n\n02:44.050 --> 02:47.890\nAs you approach the final edge. Finish with a short backstitch\n\n02:48.450 --> 02:51.810\nstop, raise the foot and clip the threads.\n\n02:52.450 --> 02:56.170\nGive the seam a quick look. Trim any thread tails and check that your seam\n\n02:56.670 --> 03:00.490\nallowance is even all the way around. Nice work. Your pouch seams\n\n03:00.990 --> 03:02.450\nare done and ready for the next step.\n\n"
