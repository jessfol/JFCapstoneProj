Mark the center\n\n00:16.422 --> 00:19.562\nof the pouch and the center of the Velcro. Those two marks will line\n\n00:20.062 --> 00:23.562\nup. Place the first strip\n\n00:24.062 --> 00:27.992\nwhere you want it, just below the top edge. You can pin\n\n00:28.492 --> 00:31.712\nit or hold it in place with your fingers.

With the needle down.\n\n01:16.692 --> 01:20.132\nGo slow over any bulk so the stitches stay even.\n\n01:20.932 --> 01:24.772\nWhen you return to the starting point, add a short backstitch,\n\n01:24.932 --> 01:26.852\nraise the foot and clip the threads.\n\n"
