The thread is laced through\n\n00:12.300 --> 00:14.760\nthe eye of the needle, which is the tiny hole at the end of the\n\n00:15.260 --> 00:19.000\nneedle. So let\'s take it from the top. To learn how to\n\n00:19.500 --> 00:20.720\nuse the automatic threader,\n\n00:26.570 --> 00:30.130\nFirst make sure the needle is up. That\'s what lets the\n\n00:30.630 --> 00:34.250\ntiny hook pass through the eye. Now bring the threader lever\n\n00:34.750 --> 00:38.010\nall the way down. You\'ll see the little flanges slide in front of the needle.\n\n00:38.510 --> 00:42.010\nThat means the hook is in position. Hold the thread\n\n00:42.170 --> 00:46.130\nin your right hand with a short tail and\n\n00:46.630 --> 00:49.370\nlay the thread in front of the needle right under those flanges.\n\n00:49.930 --> 00:53.340\nKeep the thread snug across the front. No need to pull with the\n\n00:53.840 --> 00:56.420\nthread resting there, release the lever.\n\n00:56.900 --> 01:00.060\nThe hook pops a small loop through the eye to the back. And that\'s the\n\n01:00.560 --> 01:04.180\nmagic. Reach behind the needle and grab the loop and pull it gently until the\n\n01:04.260 --> 01:07.620\nthread slides cleanly through. That helps prevent\n\n01:08.120 --> 01:11.380\nsnags when you start sewing. And that\'s it. Your needle is threaded and you\'re ready\n\n01:11.880 --> 01:11.940\nto sew.\n\n"
