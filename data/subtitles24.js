If you\'re not sure what to pick, ask a\n\n00:08.260 --> 00:11.800\nstaff member to help you choose a good woven cotton. To start, lay your fabric\n\n00:12.300 --> 00:15.200\nflat on the measurement guide and smooth out any wrinkles.\n\n00:15.919 --> 00:19.320\nLine one straight edge up with the markings so the\n\n00:19.820 --> 00:23.600\ngrain runs square. If an edge looks crooked, we\'ll trim it so\n\n00:24.100 --> 00:27.290\neverything looks straight. You can cut with scissors or\n\n00:27.790 --> 00:29.450\nwith the ruler, guard and rotary blade.\n\n00:32.410 --> 00:35.730\nTo use the guard, place the ruler on your cut line with your fingers on\n\n00:36.230 --> 00:39.690\ntop and well away from the edge. Press the orange button to engage the blade\n\n00:40.190 --> 00:43.490\nand then slide the orange guard forward to reveal it. Keep your\n\n00:43.990 --> 00:47.450\nhands clear of the blade path and make one smooth\n\n00:47.530 --> 00:50.650\npass along the ruler for a clean, straight cut.\n\n00:53.140 --> 00:56.180\nWhen you finish, slide the guard back to cover the blade.\n\n00:56.740 --> 01:00.540\nAlways close it between cuts. If the\n\n01:01.040 --> 01:04.580\nends look uneven, square them up with a small trim so\n\n01:05.080 --> 01:08.260\nyour rectangle is true. Use the guide to check your\n\n01:08.760 --> 01:10.260\nmeasurements and cut the second side.\n\n01:18.110 --> 01:21.270\nNow fold the fabric in half with the right sides together so the\n\n01:21.770 --> 01:25.350\noutside of your pouch will be on the inside for stitching. Align the\n\n01:25.850 --> 01:29.790\nedges and corners and check that the fold is straight. Place pins\n\n01:30.030 --> 01:34.190\nperpendicular to the edge about every few inches to hold the layers in place.\n\n01:34.750 --> 01:38.150\nKeep pins out of the seam path so they\'re easy to remove at\n\n01:38.650 --> 01:41.950\nthe machine, and that\'s your prep. Choose a suitable fabric measure and\n\n01:42.450 --> 01:46.100\nsquare it. Make it safe. Start straight cuts, then fold and pin ready for\n\n01:46.600 --> 01:47.220\nthe sewing machine.\n\n"
