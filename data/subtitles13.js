Start with\n\n00:05.260 --> 00:08.560\nthe presser foot up and make sure both thread tails\n\n00:09.060 --> 00:12.640\nare clear of the needle plate. Slide your fabric under\n\n00:13.140 --> 00:16.400\nthe foot and line the edge up with the seam guide\n\n00:16.900 --> 00:20.360\non the plate so everything stays straight. When you\'re\n\n00:20.860 --> 00:24.320\nset, lower the presser foot. Use the button or\n\n00:24.820 --> 00:28.320\nlever so the fabric is held firmly. Keep your hands\n\n00:28.820 --> 00:32.800\nto the sides of the needle, just guiding the fabric, not pushing\n\n00:33.300 --> 00:36.240\nor pulling. Press the petal gently to start.\n\n00:36.960 --> 00:39.440\nRemember, more pressure means faster.\n\n00:40.000 --> 00:43.760\nLess pressure slows the stitch. Aim for\n\n00:44.260 --> 00:47.520\na steady pace. To lock the seam,\n\n00:47.680 --> 00:51.280\nuse a short backstitch, press and hold reverse\n\n00:51.780 --> 00:55.200\nfor a couple of stitches, then sew forward\n\n00:55.520 --> 00:59.120\nalong your guide. Keep watching your guideline\n\n00:59.360 --> 01:03.800\nrather than the needle. Your line will be straighter as\n\n01:04.300 --> 01:07.800\nyou reach the end. Pause and add another short backstitch to secure it,\n\n01:08.300 --> 01:11.840\nthen stop. Raise the presser foot and hold the thread\n\n01:12.340 --> 01:15.400\ntails as you pull the fabric back and to the left, away from the\n\n01:15.900 --> 01:19.560\nneedle area. You can clip the threads on the side cutter or\n\n01:20.060 --> 01:22.310\nuse scissors. That\'s the whole flow.\n\n01:23.430 --> 01:27.110\nFoot up to position, foot down to engage.\n\n01:27.750 --> 01:30.230\nStart smoothly. Guide lightly,\n\n01:30.470 --> 01:33.270\nbackstitch to lock, then raise the foot and clip.\n\n01:33.430 --> 01:37.510\nOnce you\'re comfortable, you can nudge the speed up, but smooth and steady\n\n01:38.010 --> 01:38.790\nalways wins.\n\n"
