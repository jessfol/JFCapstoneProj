Slide your fabric\n\n00:11.260 --> 00:14.600\nunder the presser foot and line the edge up with a seam guide\n\n00:15.100 --> 00:18.920\non the needle plate. Use the same guide all the way so\n\n00:19.420 --> 00:21.520\nyour seam allowance stays consistent.\n\n00:26.730 --> 00:30.730\nOnce you\'re set, lower the presser foot to engage the feed dogs.\n\n00:31.130 --> 00:34.770\nPlace your hands to the sides of the needle and press the\n\n00:35.270 --> 00:39.690\npetal gently to begin. Do a short backstitch\n\n00:40.190 --> 00:43.770\nto lock the seam, then sew forward at a steady\n\n00:44.270 --> 00:48.130\npace. Let the machine feed the fabric guide\n\n00:48.630 --> 00:50.330\nlightly. Don\'t push or pull.\n\n01:03.460 --> 01:07.220\nAs you reach the end. Add another quick backstitch.\n\n01:07.860 --> 01:11.180\nStop, Raise the presser\n\n01:11.680 --> 01:17.190\nfoot and pull the fabric back into the left and\n\n01:17.690 --> 01:18.350\nclip the threads.\n\n01:29.470 --> 01:32.990\nNow let\'s sew the sides and bottom. Align the\n\n01:33.490 --> 01:36.910\nnext edge with the same seam guide. Lower the foot,\n\n01:37.150 --> 01:41.070\nbackstitch to lock and continue with a straight stitch. Remove pins\n\n01:41.570 --> 01:43.230\nas you go. Don\'t sew over them.\n\n01:44.770 --> 01:47.970\nAt the corner, stop with the needle down to hold your place.\n\n01:48.130 --> 01:49.330\nRaise the presser foot.\n\n01:53.010 --> 01:55.250\nPivot the fabric to the new direction.\n\n02:00.690 --> 02:02.450\nRealign with the guide,\n\n02:05.970 --> 02:10.340\nlower the foot and\n\n02:10.840 --> 02:11.340\nkeep sewing.\n\n02:15.020 --> 02:18.700\nRepeat that at each corner so your seams stay\n\n02:19.200 --> 02:19.260\nsquare.\n\n02:43.990 --> 02:47.830\nAs you approach the final edge. Finish with a short backstitch\n\n02:48.390 --> 02:51.750\nstop, raise the foot and clip the threads.\n\n02:52.390 --> 02:56.110\nGive the seam a quick look. Trim any thread tails and check that your seam\n\n02:56.610 --> 03:00.430\nallowance is even all the way around. Nice work. Your pouch seams\n\n03:00.930 --> 03:02.390\nare done and ready for the next step.\n\n"
