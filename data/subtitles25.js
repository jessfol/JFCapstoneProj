If you\'re not sure what to pick, ask a\n\n00:08.320 --> 00:11.860\nstaff member to help you choose a good woven cotton. To start, lay your fabric\n\n00:12.360 --> 00:15.260\nflat on the measurement guide and smooth out any wrinkles.\n\n00:15.979 --> 00:19.380\nLine one straight edge up with the markings so the\n\n00:19.880 --> 00:23.660\ngrain runs square. If an edge looks crooked, we\'ll trim it so\n\n00:24.160 --> 00:27.350\neverything looks straight. You can cut with scissors or\n\n00:27.850 --> 00:29.510\nwith the ruler, guard and rotary blade.\n\n00:32.470 --> 00:35.790\nTo use the guard, place the ruler on your cut line with your fingers on\n\n00:36.290 --> 00:39.750\ntop and well away from the edge. Press the orange button to engage the blade\n\n00:40.250 --> 00:43.550\nand then slide the orange guard forward to reveal it. Keep your\n\n00:44.050 --> 00:47.510\nhands clear of the blade path and make one smooth\n\n00:47.590 --> 00:50.710\npass along the ruler for a clean, straight cut.\n\n00:53.200 --> 00:56.240\nWhen you finish, slide the guard back to cover the blade.\n\n00:56.800 --> 01:00.600\nAlways close it between cuts. If the\n\n01:01.100 --> 01:04.640\nends look uneven, square them up with a small trim so\n\n01:05.140 --> 01:08.320\nyour rectangle is true. Use the guide to check your\n\n01:08.820 --> 01:10.320\nmeasurements and cut the second side.\n\n01:18.170 --> 01:21.330\nNow fold the fabric in half with the right sides together so the\n\n01:21.830 --> 01:25.410\noutside of your pouch will be on the inside for stitching. Align the\n\n01:25.910 --> 01:29.850\nedges and corners and check that the fold is straight. Place pins\n\n01:30.090 --> 01:34.250\nperpendicular to the edge about every few inches to hold the layers in place.\n\n01:34.810 --> 01:38.210\nKeep pins out of the seam path so they\'re easy to remove at\n\n01:38.710 --> 01:42.010\nthe machine, and that\'s your prep. Choose a suitable fabric measure and\n\n01:42.510 --> 01:46.160\nsquare it. Make it safe. Start straight cuts, then fold and pin ready for\n\n01:46.660 --> 01:47.280\nthe sewing machine.\n\n"
